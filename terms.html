                <p>Terms of Use Agreement</p>
                <p>This Agreement was last modified on July 19, 2016, and was first published and made effective on December 7, 2011.</p> 
                <p>Welcome to bloc.io, the website and online service of Bloc, Inc. (Bloc, we, or us). This page explains the terms by which you may use our online and/or mobile services, web site, and software provided on or in connection with the service (collectively the Service). By accessing or using the Service, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Terms of Use Agreement (Agreement) and to the collection and use of your information as set forth in the Bloc Privacy Policy https://www.bloc.io/privacy, whether or not you are a registered user of our Service. This Agreement applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service (Users).</p>
                <p>PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION.</p>
                <p>Bloc may, in its sole discretion, modify or update this Agreement from time to time, and so you should review this page periodically. When we change the Agreement, we will update the last modified date at the top of this page. If there are material changes to this Agreement, we will notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes prior to implementing the change or by directly sending you a notification. Your continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Use. If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Use, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service.</p>
                <p>GClout Accounts</p>
                <p>Your GClout account gives you access to the services and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. We may maintain different types of accounts for different types of Users. If you open a Bloc account on behalf of a company, organization, or other entity, then (a) you includes you and that entity, and (b) you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, and that you agree to this Agreement on the entityâ€™s behalf. By connecting to Bloc with a third-party service, you give us permission to access and use your information from that service as permitted by that service, and to store your log-in credentials for that service.</p>
                <p>You may never use another User's account without permission. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. We encourage you to use strong passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account. You must notify Bloc immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. Bloc will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account.</p>
                <p>You may control your User profile and how you interact with the Service by changing the settings in your user profile settings page. By providing Bloc your email address you consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your email address to send you other messages, such as changes to features of the Service and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out or change your preferences in your user profile settings page. Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers.</p>
                <p>Service Rules</p>
                <p>You agree not to engage in any of the following prohibited activities: (i) copying, distributing, or disclosing any part of the Service in any medium, including without limitation by any automated or non-automated scraping; (ii) using any automated system, including without limitation robots, spiders, offline readers, etc., to access the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the Bloc servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period of time by using a conventional on-line web browser (except that Bloc grants the operators of public search engines revocable permission to use spiders to copy materials from Bloc.com for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials); (iii)transmitting spam, chain letters, or other unsolicited email; (iv) attempting to interfere with, compromise the system integrity or security or decipher any transmissions to or from the servers running the Service; (v) taking any action that imposes, or may impose at our sole discretion an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure; (vi) uploading invalid data, viruses, worms, or other software agents through the Service; (vii) collecting or harvesting any personally identifiable information, including account names, from the Service; (viii) using the Service for any commercial solicitation purposes; (ix) impersonating another person or otherwise misrepresenting your affiliation with a person or entity, conducting fraud, hiding or attempting to hide your identity; (x) interfering with the proper working of the Service; (xi) accessing any content on the Service through any technology or means other than those provided or authorized by the Service; or (xii) bypassing the measures we may use to prevent or restrict access to the Service, including without limitation features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content or enforce limitations on use of the Service or the content therein.</p>
                <p>We may, without prior notice, change the Service; stop providing the Service or features of the Service, to you or to users generally; or create usage limits for the Service. We may permanently or temporarily terminate or suspend your access to the Service without notice and liability for any reason, including if in our sole determination you violate any provision of this Agreement, or for no reason. Upon termination for any reason or no reason, you continue to be bound by this Agreement.</p>
                <p>You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Bloc Users. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other Users. Bloc shall have no liability for your interactions with other Users, or for any Users action or inaction.</p>
                <p>User Content</p>
                <p>Some areas of the Service allow Users to post content such as profile information, comments, questions, and other content or information (any such materials a User submits, posts, displays, or otherwise makes available on the Service User Content). You retain ownership of your User Content.</p>
